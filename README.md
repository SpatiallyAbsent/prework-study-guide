# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I created this prework study guide to be a tool where I can store notes and other relevant data as I learn Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- It also acts as an example of what I learned early on and can be a reference tool as I delve further into the bootcamp.
- Throughout the process of creating this sight I learned fundamentals in git, some important command lines, some basic CSS and HTML, and a very early understanding of JavaScript.
- I hope to integrate more notes and usefull functionality with Javascript as the bootcamp continues forward.
